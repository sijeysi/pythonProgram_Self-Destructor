# I'm interested in this program â€”which allows the device owner to delete his/her files when someone robbed 
# him/her, or similar case, since I always lost my phone and I'm afraid when my info will leak.

# Idea: As I've said above, we can use this program to delete all files on a lost device to avoid invasion of privacy.
# We can improve this to only pop-up when the owner activate it using other trusted device. This can be a good
# type of security.
